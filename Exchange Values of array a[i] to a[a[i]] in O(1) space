#In first step, every value is incremented by (arr[arr[i]] % n)*n
#After first step array becomes {7, 2, 12, 9}. 
#The important thing is, after the increment operation
#of first step, every element holds both old values and new values. 
#Old value can be obtained by arr[i]%n and new value can be obtained
#by arr[i]/n.

#In second step, all elements are updated to new or output values 
#by doing arr[i] = arr[i]/n.
#After second step, array becomes {1, 0, 3, 2}
